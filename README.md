### Hello! My name is Chris Tiako, and this repository contains a portfolio of Python projects I have created to demonstrate my coding capabilities. In this README, I will describe what each file does, and tell you how you can test the code on your own computer.



Project 1: TicTacToe. This project allows you to play tictactoe on your computer against an automated opponent with standard tictactoe rules. To test this code, download/copy the code from Github and run it on your IDE(e.g Pycharm).


Project 2: Text-to-Speech Converter: This project allows you to input any PDF you have under 5 MB in size and generates a audio file of the contents that you can listen to. To test this code, download/copy the code from Github, and when prompted enter in the name of the PDF which you want converted into audio.


Project 3: Oil Price Scraper: This project scrapes current price data on 20+ oil products from oilprices.com and then displays these prices to the user. To test this code, download/copy the code from Github and run it on your IDE.


Project 4: Morse Code Converter: This project takes the text that you input and converts it into Morse Code. To test this code, download/copy the code from Github and when prompted enter the text that you wish to be converted into Morse Code.


Project 5: Automated Birthday Wisher: This project automatically emails a randomized birthday message at 9 AM to the person you specify. To test this code, download/copy the code from Github and change the Birthday information to the person you want to wish a happy birthday to. When prompted, change the sending and recieving email address to the applicable ones.


Project 6: Space Missions Data Analysis: In this project I analyze data on Space Launches from the 1970s and produce charts/graphs about the data using Pandas, MatplotLib and Seaborn. Some charts may not show up from the file on Github, so if you want to see all of the charts open the file in Google Colabratory.


Project 7: Fatal Force Data Analyis: In this project I analyze crime data in different American cities over the last decade+ and produce charts/graphs about the data using Pandas, MatplotLib and Seaborn. Some charts may not show up on Github, so if you want to see all of the charts open the file in Google Colabratory.


Project 8: Crude Oil Weekly Balances + Multivariable Regression: In this project I use EAI data from 2014-11-08 until the present day to perform multiple different types of analysis. To see my commentary on the data and the takeaways I took from the regressions I performed check the text file named CrudeOilCommentary where I go over all of that information.
